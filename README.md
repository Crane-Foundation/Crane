Welcome to the official repo for the Crane language
[Crane Community](https://discord.gg/mKPdeUnCmG)


## Who are we?
The Crane Foundation is a group of people who believe in making a language that is both simple and efficient in design.

## Why Crane?
Crane is a basic language designed to make your codebase readable while still maintaining the power you may get from C or Rust

## Contributing
We are always open to contributions, so just open up a thread and submit a pull request. If we like it and it works we'll merge!

## Docs
The docs are a WIP and this will be updated once available

# Syntax
Crane syntax is C styled with aspects of Rust, Python and ruby

```rb
def main() -> Void {
  std.println("Hello world!")
}
```
(No semi colons)
