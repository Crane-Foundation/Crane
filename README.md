# Crane Programming Language

## Overview

**Crane** is a statically typed, mid-level programming language designed for general-purpose use. It is known for its portability and ease of embedding into other systems. Crane is compiled to **CraneVM**, a virtual machine designed to execute Crane bytecode efficiently.

## Features

- **Statically Typed:** Crane enforces type safety at compile time, reducing runtime errors and improving code reliability.
- **Mid-Level Language:** Offers a balance between high-level abstractions and low-level control, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
- **General Purpose:** Can be used for a variety of programming tasks, from system programming to application development.
- **Embedded & Portable:** Easily embedded into other systems and highly portable across different platforms.

## Compilation to CraneVM

Crane code is compiled into bytecode that is executed by the [CraneVM](https://github.com/crane-foundation/cranevm). The compilation process ensures that Crane code can run efficiently and safely, while using minimal resources and time.

## Use Cases

Crane is suitable for:

- Developing system software and applications where performance and portability are crucial.
- Embedding into other software systems to provide scripting capabilities or custom logic.
- Writing portable code that can run on various hardware and operating systems.
